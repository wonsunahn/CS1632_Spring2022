1. Ensure you have downloaded all four of the selenium and junit jars (now included in the repo).
2. Compile with the following command: `javac -cp .:./junit-4.12.jar:./hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:./selenium-java-2.52.0.jar:./selenium-server-standalone-2.52.0.jar *.java`.  Remember to replace :'s with ;'s if you are using Windows.  If you are using Windows 7 you may need to put the classpath string (everywhere from the first `.` to the last `.jar`) in double quotes.  Also note that you must ensure that your paths do not include any ~s, wildcards, or other shell-expanding characters (if in doubt, make absolute paths).  javac will not expand these.
3. Run with the following command: `java -cp .:./junit-4.12.jar:./hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:./selenium-java-2.52.0.jar:./selenium-server-standalone-2.52.0.jar RedditTestRunner`  You should see no test failures.
4. Note, however, you will see many INFO-level warnings.  These can safely be ignored.  Run RedditTestRunnerNoLogs.java to run an equivalent test without the superfluous logging.
