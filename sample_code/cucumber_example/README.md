## Description

This is a Gherkin + Cucumber translation of the SquareTest JUnit class we
practiced in the review.  SquareTest is written as a unit test, but Cucumber is
written as a systems test.  Try doing the translation yourself by filling in
square_setSquared.feature and StepDefinitions.java.  If you are stuck, the
solutions are in square_setSquared.feature.solution and
StepDefinitions.java.solution respectively.

1. Running on the command line
