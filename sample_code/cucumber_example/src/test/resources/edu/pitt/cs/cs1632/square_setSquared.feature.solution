Feature: public void setSquared(Number n, int v)

  # This is the minimal Gherkin you need to specify and test the behavior
  # described in SquareTest.testSetSquared().
  # Rules are optional so they have been omitted.
  
  Scenario: Call setSquared with v=3 and check that n is set to 9
    Given a Square sq
    And a Number n
    When I call sq.setSquared(n, 3)
    Then n is set to 9
