# Java Assessment Exercise

DUE: Jan 14 (Friday), 2022 11:59 PM

Please accept Exercise 0 on **GitHub Classroom** using the following link:
https://classroom.github.com/a/mgi6S56f

When you accept the assignment, a new GitHub repository will be automatically
created for you with which you will do backup, versioning, and even submission.
If you are new to git versioning, please read the section [Clone the GitHub
Repository](#clone-the-github-repository) extra carefully.

## Description

The purpose of this exercise is to assess your Java programming skills coming
to this class.  On your GradeScope feedback, I may recommend that some of you
drop the course if your programming skills are not up to par.  Credit will be
given for participation but the actual score will not count towards the final
grade.

Another purpose of this exercise is to familiarize you with the workflow for
this course.  We are going to use GitHub for collaboration and source code
versioning, and also for submitting to GradeScope.  Once your code is submitted
to GradeSCope, the autograder will automatically test your code and assign a
score depending upon the pass/fail of each test case.  The autograder will also
give you valuable feedback on the deductions you got so that you can fix your
mistakes and resubmit to get a higher score.  There is no limit to the number
of submissions.

Please follow the below instructions.

## Clone the GitHub Repository

For every source code submission in this class, you are asked to create a new
GitHub repository.  Git is one of the most popular source versioning and
collaboration tools used in industry and GitHub is a major provider of that
service.  If you don't already have a GitHub account, please create one.  If
you are new to GitHub, there is a short git tutorial under the lectures folder:
[Using_Git.pdf](/lectures/Using_Git.pdf).  Please refer to it as you follow the
below instructions.

1. If you are new to git source versioning or GitHub, I recommend that you
start by using the Desktop GUI version.  You can download it from:

2. Once you've installed GitHub Desktop, let's first clone the Exercise 0 GitHub repository to your computer:

   https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop

   Please clone the GitHub Classroom repository that was created for you when you accept the assignment to your desktop.

   Whenever there are updates to the GitHub Classroom repository (for example,
somebody did a "Push" to the repository), the "Pull" request button will be
activated for the repository on GitHub Desktop.  Clicking that button will
bring your Local Repository in sync with the Remote Repository at GitHub.com.

3. Whenever you make improvements to your source code, frequently "Commit" and
   "Push" those changes to GitHub so that your new changes are versioned.

   Committing your changes will transfer the changes from the source code that
you are working on to the Local Repository creating a new version.  Pushing
your changes will upload new versions in your Local Repository to the central
Remote Repository at GitHub.com.  So only after you Push will the changes be
available to your collaborator to Pull (or yourself from a different machine).
Committing and Pushing frequently ensures that your changes are versioned and
backed up, as well as allowing your collaborators to access your changes and
keep up-to-date.

Optionally, you may decide to clone the course repository at
https://github.com/wonsunahn/CS1632_Spring2022 to your desktop as well.  Since
you don't own this repository, you will have to choose the "URL" tab when
cloning and input that URL.  Also, you will only be able to Pull from the
repository and not Push.  But if you want to have access to course materials
while offline, that is a great option.  If you do this, please make sure that
you click on "Fetch Origin" on GitHub Desktop and Pull any changes frequently
(before every class) to keep up-to-date with newly released materials.
 
## Install JDK 8

The official Java version for this class is Java 8 (1.8.0.231).  Please install the Java package for your OS at:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E76H7y2nMsrdiBwJi0nwlzczAgTKKhv7

After installation, make sure you have the correct Java and Javac versions by doing "java
-version" and "javac -version".  You should get something like the following:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_231"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_231-b11)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.231-b11, mixed mode)
```

Alternatively, you can use these versions of OpenJDK 8 that have been verified to work with our tool chain:
* https://chocolatey.org/packages/openjdk8
* https://chocolatey.org/packages/zulu8

After installing, they should show their respective versions on "java -version".  For example, for zulu8:
```
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_265"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Zulu 8.48.0.53-CA-win64) (build 1.8.0_265-b11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Zulu 8.48.0.53-CA-win64) (build 25.265-b11, mixed mode)
```

If you don't see the correct version (either for JDK 8, OpenJDK 8, or Zulu 8), please follow the below instructions to
set up the Path OS environment variable.

### Setting up JDK 8 for Windows

1. Search "environment" in the Windows 10 search box.
2. Open "Edit the system environment variables" control panel.
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" box.
4. Search the "Path" environment variable in user variables and system variables.
5. Add the bin directory of the Java installation, probably "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_231\bin" to the top of the "Path"
6. For good measure, you may want to remove other Java installations from the "Path"
7. After this, try doing "java -version" again and it should have changed.

If you use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) as your package manager, and you opted to install OpenJDK 8, you will have to replace the above Java bin path with the path where Chocolatey installs the package.

### Setting up JDK 8 for MacOS

1. Open ~/.bash_profile with your favorite editor (if you don't have one, just do "pico ~/.bash_profile")
2. Add the following 2 lines at the bottom
   ```
   export PATH=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_231.jdk/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH
   export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_231.jdk/Contents/Home/
   ```
3. Save the file and exit from the terminal
4. Relaunch the terminal and try doing "which java".  It should say /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_231.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java.
5. Now you are good to go!  Otherwise, try doing "echo $PATH" and see if your path is not updated properly, or if there is some other Java installation before you.

Alternatively, you can use [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/) that allows you to switch Java versions easily on a Mac.  You will also need [Mac brew](https://brew.sh/) if you don't already have it.  These are just one liners to install so it should be pretty painless.

It's a brew installation so it should be pretty painless.

## Compile the Code

Go to the new repository folder you created for this exercise and make sure that the Java file compiles:

```
$ mkdir bin
$ javac -d bin src/*.java

```

You should see no errors at this point

## Run and Test the Code

Try running the compiled class file:

```
$ java -cp bin SortedCollection
Usage: java SortedCollection [num1] [num2] [num3] ...
```

The SortedCollection main method just prints usage information when no
commandline arguments are passed.  With commandline arguments, it should print
out the commandline arguments in sorted order, from smallest to largest:

```
$ java -cp bin SortedCollection 3 2 1
sorted: 1 2 3
```

But at the current state, SortedCollection is incomplete and prints out:

```
$ java -cp bin SortedCollection 3 2 1
sorted: 0 0 0
```

Your job is to complete SortedCollection so that it works properly.

## Complete SortedCollection.java

The places in source code where you are asked to insert or modify code are
marked by // TODO comments.  Feel free to use any data structure from java.util
or one of your own.  It doesn't matter how you implement it as long as it works
as specified.  Pay attention to the Javadoc comments on top of each method.

## Submission

When you are done, submit your GitHub Classroom repository to GradeScope at the
"Java Assessment Exercise" link.  Once you submit, GradeScope will run the
autograder to grade you and give feedback.  If you get deductions, fix your
code based on the feedback and resubmit.  Repeat until you don't get
deductions.  Don't forget that you have to Push your changes to upload them to
the repository.

IMPORTANT: Please keep the github private!  This applies to all future submissions.

## GradeScope Feedback

GradeScope feedback is your friend.  Submit as many times as you want to get
frequent feedback.  There are 10 tests for this exercise and if there is an
error, the error message will tell you what was expected what was observed.
When the compared value is a string, brackets ([, ]) are used to annotate
exactly which part of the two strings differed.

The tests were done using an automated testing infrastructure called JUnit that
allows you to rigorously test software.  You will eventually learn to use this
tool too as part of this course!  You can get a sneak peak to see what is being
tested by viewing [gradescope_autograder/SortedCollectionGrading.java](gradescope_autograder/SortedCollectionGrading.java).  If you
don't get a perfect score, that might actually help.  A common programming
error is to use class variables instead of instance variables, for example.
